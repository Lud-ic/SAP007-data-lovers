            Studio Ghibli, acclaimed Japanese animation film studio that was
            founded in 1985 by animators and directors Miyazaki Hayao and
            Takahata Isao and producer Suzuki Toshio. Studio Ghibli is known for
            the high quality of its filmmaking and its artistry. Its feature
            films won both critical and popular praise and influenced other
            animation studios. The headquarters are in Tokyo. In 1984 Miyazaki
            made his second feature film, Kaze no tani no Naushika (Nausica채 of
            the Valley of the Wind), which was based on his own popular manga
            strip, and the following year Miyazaki, Takahata, and Suzuki
            established Studio Ghibli. The first official Studio Ghibli release
            was Tenk큰 no shiro Rapyuta (1986; Castle in the Sky). Most of the
            films produced by Studio Ghibli were written and directed by
            Miyazaki and include, in addition to the aforementioned, Tonari no
            Totoro (1988; My Neighbor Totoro), Majo no takky큰bin (1989; Kiki's
            Delivery Service), and Kurenai no buta (1992; Porco Rosso). The
            studio's best-known movie, Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (2001;
            Spirited Away), won several awards, notably the Golden Bear at the
            2002 Berlin International Film Festival and the 2003 Academy Award
            for best animated feature. Later films included Hauru no ugoku shiro
            (2004; Howl's Moving Castle), Gake no ue no Ponyo (2008; Ponyo),
            Kaze tachinu (2013; The Wind Rises), and Kaguyahime no monogatari
            (2013; The Tale of the Princess Kaguya). In 2001 the
            Miyazaki-designed Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Japan. Its
            attractions included exhibits about animation and original short
            films from Studio Ghibli. Source:
